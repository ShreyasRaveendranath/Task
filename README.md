# Task
Wav2Lip is a lip-syncing algorithm that generates a talking video of a person from an audio input.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine or Google Colab.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NVIDIA CUDA (if you plan to use GPU for acceleration)

### Installation

1. Clone the Wav2Lip repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

cd Wav2Lip
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage

1. Prepare the input files:

Place your video file (e.g., `mona1min.mp4`) and the corresponding audio file (e.g., `output10.wav`) in the `sample_data/` folder.

2. Run the lip-syncing inference:

cd Wav2Lip
python inference.py --checkpoint_path checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth --face "/path/to/mona1min.mp4" --audio "/path/to/output10.wav"


Copy code

Replace `/path/to/mona1min.mp4` and `/path/to/output10.wav` with the actual paths to your video and audio files, respectively.

The lip-synced video will be generated and saved in the `results/` folder.
